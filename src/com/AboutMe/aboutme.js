                I'm Md Abu Nayeb Towki, a recent Computer Science graduate from Brunel University London with a growing passion for artificial intelligence, full-stack development, and solving real-world problems through technology.

                <br /><br />

                My academic background has given me a strong foundation in software engineering and web development. I’ve built responsive and dynamic applications using modern frameworks like React and Node.js, and I'm comfortable working with JavaScript, Python, and Java. More recently, I’ve started exploring AI and machine learning—developing projects that apply NLP and classification techniques.

                <br /><br />

                I enjoy working in collaborative environments and constantly seek opportunities to learn and grow. My portfolio showcases a mix of practical projects that reflect my technical skills, creativity, and curiosity.

                <br /><br />

                Outside of tech, I enjoy playing badminton to stay active, going on long drives, and exploring mobile photography. These hobbies keep me balanced and inspired in both personal and professional life.
