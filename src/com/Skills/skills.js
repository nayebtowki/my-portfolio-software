                    <p>
                    I build responsive and dynamic web applications using technologies like React, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy working on both the frontend and backend, creating seamless user experiences while learning to write clean, maintainable code and integrate APIs and databases.

                    <p>
                    I'm actively learning and experimenting with machine learning models using Python, Scikit-learn, and NLP libraries. My recent projects include classifying AI vs. human text and building simple automation scripts. Iâ€™m interested in how AI and scripting can improve system efficiency and decision-making.
